libft is a 42School project which creates a first C library with convenience functions. Some are reprogrammed libc functions, some our own convenience functions, some linked list functions.

This project was written for and compiled on a Mac.
Make with make bonus for all functions, that yields a libft.a.

This project was a 42School project, we had to program according to a strict norm, for instance using only while loops, having only 25 lines per function etc.
